The primary goal of this project is to efficiently process a [massive](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmazonScience/massive) dataset. It focuses on the generation of language-specific files, such as 'en-xx.xlsx,' for various languages, including English (en), Swahili (sw), and German (de). Furthermore, the project involves the creation of separate JSONL files for English (en), Swahili (sw) and German (de) containing test, train, and dev data. Additionally, it aims to produce a single JSON file that encompasses translations from English to all other languages, featuring both 'id' and 'utt' data for the training sets. To ensure efficient handling of the dataset and mitigate potential memory and time complexity issues, this project avoids the use of recursive algorithms.
